# MysteryMansion
A Python rebuild of the Electronic Talking Mystery Mansion board game.


### Wait, why?
My family *loves* this game. As kids, we used to play it all the time. At a recent family event, we wanted to play it and discovered that the "computer" part wasn't reliably working. I joked that I could recreate the game... and a couple hours of tinkering later, we were playing again.
